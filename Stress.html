</br>Abstract: This paper deals with stress and its biology, which is 
a major problem for students throughout the modern world. It 
outlines and suggests stress management techniques, which are 
easy to practice for students and teachers even during lessons,
e.g. japanese finger stress relief techniques and yoga pranayama. 
Stress is a significant problem of our times and affects both the 
physical and mental health of people. The main objectives are to 
ascertain the extent to which stress affects students’ academic 
success and health and to suggest some techniques and pratices to 
cope with stress for students. Stress coping methods are the 
physiological, cognitive, behavioral and psychological methods to
deal with stress. The main method used has been to gather and 
analyse the relavant data. <br>
</br>For this purpose questionnaires about stress were randomly 
distributed to different student groups mostly at three 
Kazakhstani universities. The results obtained show that students 
need to be given effective techniques to cope with stress while 
they are studying. After a thorough literature review in major 
databases stress management techniques were identified and are 
presented and briefly discussed here. Stress can be managed 
through the introduction of a stress management course and 
engaging in extracurricular physical and mental activities. These 
techniques are easy to learn and practice, with excelent results in 
individuals with sound health or even those with health issues. 
They are beneficial and very helpful for both students and 
teachers.<br>
</br>Keywords: stress, mental health problems and promotion, 
intervention, treatment, academic performance and stress 
management techniques, methods and well-being.<br>
</br>I. INTRODUCTION<br>
</br>Stress is a reality of everyday life. The term “stress” used 
first in physics in order to analyze the problem of how man-
made structures must be designed to carry heavy loads and 
resist deformation. With the transition from physics to the 
behavioral sciences, the usage of the term “stress” changed 
[1]. According to Wheeler C. M. [2] stress is a word of 
physics, which refers to the amount of force used on an object 
and it relates in real life to how certain issues that carry force 
are applied to humans. Examples like financial difficulties, 
health issues, personal conflicts and work issues all carry force 
or pressure on a person's body, mind and spirit. Some of the 
pressures originate from the environment but most often it 
emanates from within a person's head in the form of worry, 
anxiousness, regret, discouragement and low confidence and 
self-esteem. This article uses the term “stress” in the context 
of mental health. For roughly the last 50 years the term stress 
has increasingly been used in the behavioral and health 
sciences. The accompanying social “theory” explains 
observations about stress as an aspect of student life. Our 
findings about stress confirmed, that Kazakhstani students at 
universities always experience a significant amount of stress 
during their academic life and they need ways to help to cope 
with it. Undoubtedly, stress has become the number one 
reported impediment to academic performance. A Publication 
of New York University [3] stated that 55% of students 
claimed their biggest stressor to be academic in nature. 6 in 10 
college students report having felt so stressed they could not 
do their studies on one or more occasion. Stress is the process 
by which a person reacts when faced with external or internal 
problems and challenges. “The organism processes numerous 
systems to coordinate such adaptive responses both at
systematic and cellular levels,” that means, stress has direct 
effects on the brain and the whole anatomy of the body: failure 
to adapt to a stressful condition can result in brain 
malfunctions, physiological problems and also areas of
psychological challenges in the form of depression, anxiety, 
pain and burnout [3]. Additionally, many of the emotional and 
physical symptoms that occur commonly in the student 
population, such as headaches, fatigue, depression, anxiety, 
and the inability to cope, can be attributed to or exacerbated 
by stress [4]. Surveys conducted by Kansas State University 
reveal a 58% increase in stress-related mental health issues 
reported to campus counsellors between 1988 and 2001 [5]. 
These increased stress loads come with some dire 
consequences. Suicide rates amongst college-aged students are 
three times higher than they were in 1950, as described 
 American College Health Association statistics published in 
Psychology Today (Retrieved on March 10, 2016). 
Types of Stressors [3]: When individuals search for help, 
they are regularly managing conditions, circumstances, and 
stressors in their life that leave them feeling emotionally and 
physically disturbed. Countless people feel that they have very 
little resources or assistance to deal with the high levels of 
stress they are experiencing. Circumstances that trigger stress 
are known as “stressors”. According to [3] stress is not only 
because of negative things; positive things also cause stress. In 
our life we only know stress to be bad but that is not the case. 
There are two types of stress: eustress and distress. There are 
some positive situations that cause a person to be stressed, like 
promotion at work, starting a new job, getting married, having 
a child, etc. Positive stressors are usually not noticed because 
of the following characteristics: <br>
</br>• It is a short term event; <br>
</br>• It feels very exciting; <br>
</br>• It improves one’s attitude and performance;<br>
</br>• It motivates people. <br>
</br>On the other hand, negative stressors are easily noticed. 
Examples of negative stressors are: death of a loved one, 
unemployment, divorce, illness, etc. There are also some 
characteristics of negative stressors, which make it easier for 
them to be noticed: <br>
</br>• It causes anxiety and makes one disturbed; 
• Even though it may be short, it can have long term 
implications; 
• It decreases ones’ productivity and lowers morale. 
In the book of Brain by Luke Seaward in G. Essel and P. 
Owusu [3], he also also mentions some other types of stress 
which are different in their own ways. For example, there is 
the neustress and “this is any kind of information or sensory 
stimulus that is perceived as unimportant”. 
In this paper we discuss how student stress impacts 
academic performance and can cause mental health problems 
and their consequences in academic life. We provide some 
methods on how to cope with stress and to avoid mental health 
issues during the study period. <br>
</br>II. MATERIALS AND METHODS <br>
</br>The biology of stress 
Although the stress response is very complex, we can 
focus on two major stress systems. 
First: the rapid autonomous nervous system is activated 
within seconds to release catecholamines from the adrenal 
medulla and the locus coeruleus in the brain stem. 
Catecholamines (Adrenalin and Noradrenalin) are implicated 
in the ‘fight-or-flight’ response (activation of circulation and 
breathing, but they also have profound effects on attention, 
working memory and long-term memory. If after this first 
action there is no danger, the stress response will be finished! 
If not, the second action starts: “Somewhat slower, the 
hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis is activated, releasing 
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the 
hypothalamus, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to 
secrete the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH in 
turn causes the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol and release it 
into the blood stream. Cortisol reaches peak level 
concentrations ~20–30 min. after stress onset and readily 
enters the brain to affect cognition and behaviour. Cortisol 
binds to two different receptors: the glucocorticoid receptor 
(GR) is expressed ubiquitously throughout the brain, whereas 
the mineralcorticoid receptor (MR) is mainly expressed in the 
brain regions related to memory and emotion (Hippocampus, 
Amygdala, Prefrontal Cortex). On binding to these receptors, 
cortisol operates via two different modes of action: a non-
genomic, often MR-mediated mode develops rapidly and 
enhances neural excitability in the Amygdala and 
Hippocampus, presumably supporting memory formation. 
This rapid …
 nerve cells) density in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex 
is reduced. These processes are reversible to some extent, 
especially in young animals and humans; physical exercise, 
for example, has a positive influence [8]! 
Stress shortens the so-called telomeres and accelerates 
aging! A telomere is a region of repetitive nucleotide 
sequences at each end of a chromosome, which protects the 
end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with 
neighboring chromosomes. Its name is derived from the Greek 
nouns telos (τέλος) «end» and merοs (μέρος, root: μερ-) 
«part» [9]. 
Important arguments for making teaching and 
learning less stressful 
The stress processes in the brain are very complex and

 to address the following questions and almost all the answers 
were approximately similar. 
Questions given to the students: 
How do you understand the word stress? 
Typical answers given by students: A state of mental or 
emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or 
demanding circumstances; 
The state of a person in which they experience negative 
emotions, also it affects the physical energy of a person 
causing fatigue; 
Stress is your body’s way of responding to any kind of 
demand; when your morale is very low; 
Stress is primarily a physical response activated by 
negative mental attitudes. 
When stressed, the body thinks it is under attack and 
switches to 'fight or flight' mode, releasing a complex mix of 
hormones and chemi…
