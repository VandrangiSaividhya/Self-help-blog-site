</br> Behavioral techniques for treating depression frequently have been
        paired with a variety of cognitive interventions (Beck, Rush, Shaw, &
        Emery, 1979; Lewinsohn, Munoz, Youngren, & Zeiss, 1986).
        Research suggests, however, that it is the behavioral component of
        treatment (e.g., behavioral activation) that is sufficient for the allevia-
        tion of overt depressive symptoms as well as modification of
        maladaptive cognitions and improvement of life functioning (Gortner,<br>

        Gollan, Dobson, & Jacobson, 1998; Jacobson, Dobson, Truax, &
        Addis, 1996; Jacobson & Gortner, 2000; Simons, Garfield, &
        Murphy, 1984). Despite data supporting use of behavioral activation
        in the treatment of depression, there have been few published and eas-
        ily accessible resources that provide an explicit, step-by-step protocol
        for the provision of a purely behavioral activation treatment.<br>
    </br>To address this gap in the literature, we designed the Brief Behav-
        ioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD) (Lejuez, Hopko,
        LePage, Hopko, & McNeil, in press), which provides clinicians with a
        powerful behavioral intervention to treat depression in a succinct and
        parsimonious package. Although the principles and processes under-
        lying BATD are focused on behavioral activation, cognitive and emo-
        tional processes are not ignored. Moreover, although not directly tar-
        geted for change, these cognitive aspects of depression are presumed
        to become more adaptive following behavioral activation procedures
        and are assessed frequently across sessions as an index of treatment
        gains. Finally, we do not deny the potential effects of resulting covert
        changes; we merely assert that activation should be the direct target
        for change in a cycle that may lead to the long-term remission of
        depression.<br>
    </br> The advantages of this protocol lie in its ease of implementation,
        including the absence of difficult skills for therapists to acquire. Addi-
        tionally, this protocol easily is tailored to the ideographic needs of a
        particular patient. Within this structure, patients and practitioners col-
        laborate to identify individualized target behaviors, goals, and
        rewards that serve to reinforce nondepressive or healthy behavior.
        Finally, considering the restrictions being imposed by health mainte-
        nance organizations, the time-efficient and cost-effective nature of
        BATD makes it a viable treatment option.<br>
    </br>We developed BATD to specifically target contextual factors that
        affect behavior, using the matching law as a guiding principle (Lejuez
        et al., in press). According to the matching law (Hernstein, 1961,
        1970), the proportion of behavior allocated to one alternative relative
        to a second possible alternative is equal to the proportion of obtained
        reinforcers on the first alternative relative to the second alternative.
        Applied to clinical depression, the matching law suggests that the rel-
        ative frequency of depressed behavior compared with nondepressed 
In general, if you believe that completing a particular activitywould bring a sense of pleasure and/or accomplishment, then it probably would be good to include it.<br></br> When selecting activities, they shouldbe both observable by others and measurable. Therefore, a generalgoal like “thinking more positively” is not appropriate. Instead, amore appropriate activity might include “visiting my brother at leasttwice per week.” Sometimes it is tempting to select very difficultactivities for which the benefits are very delayed or uncertain. Toaddress this potential difficulty without limiting your ambition, selectactivities of various difficulty, with only a few being more difficultlong-term projects. To improve the likelihood of initial success andease your transition into the program, three of the activities should beLejuez et al. / BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION 269Figure 4. Life Areas Assessment.270 BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION / April 2001Figure </br> </br> . Activity Difficulty Level Ranking Sheet.taken from activities you already are completing on a regular basis(see your completed Figure 2 for assistance).In total, you should select 15 activities that are personalized to yourown needs and desires as much as possible. As you select an activity,add it to Figure 5, in no particular order, and then rank them from 1(least difficult) to 15 (most difficult).Lejuez et al. / BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION 271Figure 6. Activity Hierarchy.Creating the activity hierarchy<br> </br> . After you have constructed andranked your list of activities on Figure 5, assign the first 3 activities toLevel 1, the 4th through 6th activities to Level 2, the 7th through 9th272 BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION / April 2001activities to Level 3, the 10th through 12th activities to Level 4, and the13th to 15th activities to Level 5 (see Figure 6). As discussed above,Level 1 activities should include those that you are already engagingin to some degree (see the daily monitoring record), but you may wishto use activities that you would like to do even more frequently. Forexample, if you are currently getting out of bed before 9:00 a.m. 1 daya week, you may include this with the expectation that you ultimatelywould like to accomplish this several more times in a given week. Anexample of a completed activity hierarchy is provided in Appendix B.UNIT 6: CHARTING PROGRESSThe master activity log and the behavior checkout. Once you haveidentified the 15 target activities, you will need a plan for how you willwork these activities into your life and how you will assess your progress. The master activity log (see Figure 7) is a useful way of trackingyour progress on a weekly basis. In the first column, you and yourtreatment provider will copy your activity hierarchy, listing all of yourproposed activities. In the columns next to the activity, you should listthe following: (a) the number of times you eventually would like tocomplete the activity in a 1-week period (i.e., ideal frequency) and (b)the duration of the activity (you may write UF, signifying that theactivity will continue until finished regardless of the duration). Tostart, you and your treatment provider should select the first few activities to chart for the coming week. We recommend charting two tothree activities during the first week. The number of activities willvary each week but should range anywhere between three to five activities per week. Your input will be critical in determining goal selection, as it will be important that you are challenging yourself withoutbecoming overwhelmed. For each activity selected for a given week,write down the frequency (#) and duration (Time) goals in the appropriate columns. Both you and your treatment provider should have acopy of the master activity log, and it should be completed on a weeklybasis. Before completing the master activity log for the first time,make a few copies for future weeks.273Figure 7. Master Activity Log. The label # indicates frequency of a given activity and the label Time indicates duration of a given activity.274 BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION / April 2001Now you are ready to record your progress on a daily basis, usingthe weekly behavior checkout (see Figure 8). Similar to the masteractivity log, you write down the frequency and duration goals in theappropriate columns for each activity you have selected for that week.Each day you circle Y if you completed the activity and N if you didnot. To ensure that you maintain accurate records, it is best if you allocate a specific time of the day to complete this task (e.g., before bedtime). Once you complete the desired frequency and duration goal forthe week, you may circle G as well as Y orN. Circling G acknowledgesthat regardless of whether you engaged in that activity on that day, youhave successfully met your goal for the week. Furthermore, circling Gshould help to keep you from feeling guilty about not completing anactivity on a given day if you are regularly completing your weeklygoals. Again, you should complete the behavior checkout on a dailybasis.After a given week has come to an end, you should go back to theMaster Activity Log and record the number of times that you met bothyour frequency and duration goals for a particular activity in the “Do”column. If you met (or exceeded) your goal, you might want toincrease the frequency and/or duration for the following week (assuming you have not yet met the ideal goal).<br> </br>  If you did not meet your goal,you and your treatment provider should decide if the weekly goal was(a) reasonable and missed due to unforeseen circumstances or (b)unreasonable or set too high. In the former case, you could leave thegoal the same for the next week, but in the latter case you mightstrongly consider reducing the weekly goal (and potentially rethinking the ideal goal). In the case that your weekly goal is the same as theideal goal, and you have met this goal 3 weeks in a row, the activitywill be considered mastered. Once you have achieved mastery for anyone activity, you no longer chart it each week, but instead, you maysimply write M under “goal” and “Do” on the master activity log. Youmay use mastery of one activity as a cue to add a new activity to becharted; however, the speed at which new activities are added canoccur more slowly or quickly and should be decided based on yourindividual circumstances. For a completed sample of the master activity log and behavior checkout, see Appendix C.275Figure 8. Behavior Checkout.276 BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION / April 2001Figure 9. Rewards list.REWARDING PROGRESSIt is important to reward yourself for achieving your weekly goals.Scheduling rewards at the end of each week gives you something tolook forward to and provides motivation for completing your behaviorcheckout.<br> </br>  Use Figure 9 to make a list of possible rewards for completing your weekly goals. The rewards that you choose should be attainable and within your control. Pick items that are enticing enough tomotivate you to work toward obtaining them and that you will engageLejuez et al. / BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION 277Figure 10. Activity Graph.in only if you have completed your goals. Consider referring back toAppendix A for ideas if you are having trouble, but do not pick anactivity on your activity hierarchy as a reward.Graphing your progress.<br> </br>  Sometimes it is helpful to use a visual toolsuch as a graph to assess your progress. You can create a graph both forLejuez et al. / BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION 279(which may be somewhat jagged) slanted upward from the bottom leftto the upper right of the page. For the BDI-II graph (see Figure 11),you can find the particular administration of the questionnaire on thehorizontal axis (i.e., look for the number 3 on the horizontal axis if it isthe third time you have completed the questionnaire) and mark thescore according to the scale on the vertical axis. On successful completion of this program, the graph should indicate a line (which may besomewhat jagged) slanted downward from the top left to the bottomright of the page. Complete your graphs on a weekly basis (see Figures10 and 11).<br> </br> NOTE1.
